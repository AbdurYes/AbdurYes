<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Building The Future Through Innovation

At just 14 years old, I'm merging my Commerce education with my passion for technology and entrepreneurship. Age is just a number when it comes to making an impact.

My journey started with a curiosity about how technology can solve real-world problems. Over time, this has evolved into building practical solutions while learning essential business principles.

Beyond studying and coding, I enjoy exploring innovative business ideas, staying up-to-date with emerging technologies, and collaborating with like-minded individuals to bring ideas to life.
